# Assignment 5: Planner

## Description

- This project was created to provide a scheduling solution for students with a 9-5 schedule.
- The schedule provides nine blocks, each of which can be editted and saved to local storage.
- By providing a way for students to save their schedules long term, we hope to offer a scheduling solution which can help them to organize both their personal and professional lives.
- Working on this project has helped me to better learn how to travers the DOM, and access local browser storage.
